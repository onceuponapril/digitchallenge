In the "input" block, you can press anything including integer, characters, marks,etc. on keyboard. 
Then you will see a sum of integers shown in your inputs.
For example: when you input "3456 789", you can get 4245 as output. 
The non-digits elements will be ignored in the output, which means it only extracts digits in the input.
